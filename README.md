## Full Stack Web App Template - FARM Stack

This repository contains a full stack web application template that runs on the FARM solution stack, which stands for:
- **F**lask, a backend **Python** web framework.
- **A**pache, a web server that runs the web applications.
- **R**eact, a frontend **JavaScript** web framework.
- **M**ySQL, a relational database management system.

This particular template does not use an ORM, and there is no opinion for what operating system to use.

### Flask
Flask is used to write the web APIs / middleware that can communicate between the web UI and the web backend / database. This is the core of the entire application that glues the pieces of the full stack application together.

### Apache
Apache HTTP Server is used to run and deploy the web application to production.

### React
React is the framework which the web UI runs on. The React application may also be run on Apache.

### MySQL
MySQL is the relational database which the web backend uses.
